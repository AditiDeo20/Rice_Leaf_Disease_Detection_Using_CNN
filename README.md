# 🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Classification with Deep Learning

This project develops and evaluates a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify rice leaf diseases using image data. The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural experts in **early and accurate detection** of rice diseases, helping prevent crop loss.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Rice plants are prone to various diseases that can significantly reduce yield. **Manual detection is time-consuming and error-prone**, especially at early stages when symptoms are subtle. This project uses deep learning to automatically classify rice leaf images into:

- **Bacterial Leaf Blight**
- **Brown Spot**
- **Leaf Smut**
